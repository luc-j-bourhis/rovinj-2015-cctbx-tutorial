An introduction to the cctbx
----------------------------

The cctbx is a Python library providing tools for the whole crystallographic workflow for single crystals, for both small structures and macromolecular ones. This tutorial will be a gentle introduction to it. First I will describe its various components and the interactions between them, as well as the relations with popular suites such as Phenix and Olex 2. The tutorial per se will then work through a few simple example, mostly focusing on transforming unit cells and changing space groups for a structure in the process of being refined. This will demonstrate how to manipulate the most commonly used objects in the library.

The participants should have a decent knowledge of unit cells and space groups. Some experience of Python is recommended.

This tutorial was given at the school "Advanced Software Development for Crystallographers", 20th-22nd of August 2015, in Rovinj, Croatia.
